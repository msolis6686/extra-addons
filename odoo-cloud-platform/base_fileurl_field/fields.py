        .. rubric:: FileURL fields

        FileURL fields is intended to store Binary data on an external storage
         with the possibility to be accessed outside of odoo.

        :param storage_location: Required external storage that must be
         activated on the system (cf base_attachment_storage)

        :param storage_path: Path to be used as a prefix to the filename in the
         storage solution (must be used with filename)

        :param filename: Field on the same model which stores the filename.
         Will be used to set fname on ir.attachment and, if storage_path is
         defined, will be passed to force the storage key.
