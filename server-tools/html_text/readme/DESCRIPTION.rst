This module provides some technical features that allow to extract text from
any chunk of HTML, without HTML tags or attributes. You can chose either:

* To truncate the result by amount of words or characters.
* To append an ellipsis (or any character(s)) at the end of the result.

It can be used to easily generate excerpts.
